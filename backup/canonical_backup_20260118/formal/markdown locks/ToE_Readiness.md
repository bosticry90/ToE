\# ToE\_Readiness.md



“This document defines what it would mean for the present program to legitimately claim progress toward a Theory of Everything (ToE), and sets explicit readiness criteria for publication or pivot.”



---



\## 0. Purpose



The purpose of this document is \*\*not\*\* to claim a ToE.

It is to define \*when such a claim would even be meaningful\*, given the current results.



This prevents premature overreach and clarifies what has \*actually\* been achieved.



---



\## 1. What is currently established (locked)



Based on Phase A–D results, the following are \*\*locked or provisionally locked\*\*:



\* \*\*DR-01\*\*: A quadratic dispersion relation derived from EQ-02 and redundantly verified.

\* \*\*CT-01\*\*: A dispersion-preservation constraint: admissible modifications must not alter DR-01 under ψ = 0 linearization.

\* \*\*Phase B (Lean)\*\*: Structural proof that perturbations satisfying probe-relative admissibility leave DR-01 unchanged.

\* \*\*Phase C1\*\*: FN-01 is not forced by current locked constraints; Candidate B is variationally closed under stated assumptions.

\* \*\*Phase D1\*\*: Geometry is not forced by DR-01/CT-01 within current scope.



These establish a \*\*constraint-first framework\*\* rather than a law-first or geometry-first one.

\## 2. What this means for “ToE” claims



A Theory of Everything, at minimum, must:



1\. Explain \*\*why certain structures are unavoidable\*\* (not merely postulated).

2\. Account for \*\*why certain laws appear stable\*\* under perturbation.

3\. Clarify \*\*what is fundamental vs emergent\*\*.



At present:



\* We do \*\*not\*\* have a ToE.

\* We \*\*do\*\* have a framework that identifies \*selection principles\* governing what kinds of theories survive.



This places the work \*\*upstream\*\* of traditional ToE efforts.



---



\## 3. What is fundamental \*so far\*



Based strictly on locked results, the most fundamental elements are:



\* \*\*Operator admissibility\*\* (what kinds of terms are allowed at all)

\* \*\*Constraint invariance\*\* (what cannot change without breaking consistency)



Notably \*not\* fundamental (yet):



\* Geometry

\* Coherence

\* Specific interaction terms

\* Minimality pressure (unnecessary structure is unstable)/working heuristic



These may still emerge, but are not axiomatic.



---



\## 4. Readiness criteria for publication



A publication is justified if the paper:



\* Clearly states \*\*what is not being claimed\*\* (no ToE claim).

\* Demonstrates a \*\*constraint-first selection framework\*\*.

\* Shows at least one \*\*nontrivial survival test\*\* (e.g., FN-01 Candidate B).

\* Explicitly demotes geometry and coherence from foundational status.



Such a paper would be positioned as:



> A framework for identifying inevitabilities in physical law, not a final theory.



---



\## 5. Criteria for advancing toward a ToE



Progress toward a ToE would require at least one of:



\* A new \*\*forced invariant\*\* that survives all admissible deformations.

\* A derivation showing \*\*why quantum or relativistic structure must appear\*\*.

\* A proof that known forces arise as \*the only stable solutions\*.



Until then, the correct posture is:



> Constraint discovery, not unification claims.



---



\## 6. Decision



\*\*Current status:\*\* Pre-ToE foundational research.



\*\*Next legitimate directions:\*\*



\* Identify additional constraint layers.

\* Test whether known physics is \*forced\* by them.

\* Avoid introducing structure without necessity.



---



\## 7. Exit condition



This document is complete when it prevents either:



\* Premature ToE claims, or

\* Loss of direction due to over-demotion of results.



Phase E is therefore \*\*open but scoped\*\*.
