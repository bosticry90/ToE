“This document tests whether any effective geometric structure is unavoidable given DR-01 and the dispersion-preserving constraint set, or whether geometry is a removable interpretive layer.”

\## 0. Purpose and scope



\*\*Goal (Phase D1):\*\* Determine whether an effective geometric description (metric, curvature, causal structure) is \*forced\* by the locked dispersion relation DR-01 and its associated constraint structure, or whether geometry remains an optional interpretive lens.



This document proceeds by \*\*reversal of implication\*\*:



> Not “dispersion ⇒ geometry,”  

> but “given dispersion + constraints, is geometry unavoidable?”



---



\## 1. Objects currently invoking geometry



The following epistemic objects introduce geometric language or structure:



\### MT-01 — Acoustic metric

\- \*\*Category:\*\* Metric  

\- \*\*Status:\*\* Structural (Lean)  

\- \*\*Role:\*\* Encodes DR-01 as an effective wave metric in the linear regime.

\- \*\*Dependency:\*\* DR-01



\### BR-01 — Dispersion to metric mapping

\- \*\*Category:\*\* Bridge  

\- \*\*Status:\*\* Spec-backed  

\- \*\*Role:\*\* Interprets dispersion as arising from an effective spacetime geometry.

\- \*\*Dependency:\*\* DR-01, MT-01



\*\*Observation:\*\*  

Neither MT-01 nor BR-01 is required to \*derive\*, \*state\*, or \*use\* DR-01 as a dispersion relation.



---



\## 2. What breaks if geometry is removed?



We now perform a hypothetical deletion test.



\### Remove MT-01 (acoustic metric)



Effects:

\- No direct dependence has been recorded in State\_of\_the\_Theory.md that makes MT-01 or BR-01 prerequisites for DR-01, EQ-02, CT-01, or OP-01; removing them should not affect those items unless downstream files explicitly import or assume them.



Result:

\- All core dynamical and constraint structures remain intact.

\- Only geometric \*interpretation\* is removed.



\### Remove BR-01 (dispersion → metric bridge)



Effects:

\- No loss of currently locked internal results (EQ-02/DR-01/CT-01/OP-01) within the present scope.

\- No contradiction introduced at the level of items recorded in State\_of\_the\_Theory.md.”

\- No constraint violation (CT-01) introduced.



Result:

\- Dispersion is no longer interpreted geometrically, but remains fully functional.



\*\*Intermediate conclusion:\*\*  

Geometry is not required for internal consistency, dispersion derivation, or constraint enforcement.

\## 3. Dispersion-preserving features (geometry candidates)



We now ask:



> Are there features preserved (i) under the intended CT-01 ψ=0 linearization criterion, and (ii) under the current Lean probe-relative admissibility condition?



\### Preserved features (by criterion)



From DR-01 and CT-01, the following are preserved features:



\- Plane-wave solutions with quadratic ω(k)

\- Coefficient-equality structure under operator action

\- Absence of linear modifications under admissible perturbations

\- Isotropic quadratic dependence ω(k)=|k|²/2 in the ψ=0 linearization (a property of the Laplacian form in EQ-02/DR-01)



\### Assessment



\- These preserved features are \*\*algebraic and spectral\*\*, not geometric.

\- None require a notion of distance, metric signature, curvature, or causal cone.

\- The same preserved features arise in:

&nbsp; - non-geometric spectral problems,

&nbsp; - lattice models,

&nbsp; - purely operator-theoretic frameworks.



\*\*Key point:\*\*  

Quadratic dispersion alone does not force a metric interpretation.



---



\## 4. Attempt to force geometry (stress test)



We now attempt the strongest reasonable claim:



> Suppose geometry is removed everywhere. Does any contradiction arise?



Answer:

\- No contradiction.

\- No loss of currently locked internal results (EQ-02/DR-01/CT-01/OP-01) within the present scope.

\- No currently used quantity in the locked internal results becomes undefined (EQ-02/DR-01/CT-01/OP-01).



Therefore:



> Geometry is \*\*not forced\*\* by DR-01 or its preservation constraints.



---



\## 5. Decision: forced vs optional



\### Verdict



\- Geometry is \*\*optional\*\*, not necessary.

\- MT-01 and BR-01 function as \*\*interpretive lenses\*\*, not laws.



\### Epistemic consequence



\- Geometry must \*\*not\*\* be elevated to foundational status at this stage.

\- Any future geometric claims must be:

&nbsp; - explicitly labeled interpretive, or

&nbsp; - justified by new forced invariants not yet present.



---



\## 6. Status implications (no edits applied yet)



\*\*No immediate status changes are applied in this document.\*\*



However, the following implications are recorded for Phase E consideration:



\- MT-01 remains Structural (Lean), but non-essential.

\- BR-01 remains Spec-backed and explicitly optional.

\- No geometric object is promoted to “forced structure.”



---



\## 7. Exit condition for Phase D



Phase D is complete when:



\- Geometry is either shown to be forced \*\*or\*\*

\- Explicitly shown to be removable without contradiction



\*\*This document establishes the latter.\*\*



Phase D1 is complete relative to the current DR-01/CT-01 notion of dispersion preservation and the current probe-relative Lean formalization.
