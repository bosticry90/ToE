**Unified Roadmap for Viability Advancement**

STATUS: ACTIVE (needs periodic revision)

Tooling maturity update (current reality):

- State_of_the_Theory.md is authoritative; IDs, dependencies, and evidence paths are enforced.
- Bridges use front-door APIs with candidate tables + import bans.
- Empirical artifacts exist (typed, fingerprinted fit objects) and are the only allowed bridge inputs.
- Behavioral locks (roundtrip/probe-relative) are treated as guardrails, not global proofs.

Recommended framing (discriminative science loops):

Loop template:
1) Define/collect a minimal empirical artifact (e.g., DR-01 fit artifact with data_fingerprint)
2) Push it through a bridge (e.g., BR-01 metric output)
3) Predict an observable signature under candidate family Y
4) Compare to data/anchor Z (or internal invariance locks)
5) Prune/eliminate candidates (FN pruning) and record the surviving set + evidence

### I. Roadmap to Advance Each Layer

#### 1. Formal Field Architecture

**Goal:** Ensure derivability, reduction, and consistency of field equations.

* **Milestone 1:** Prove that CRFT/CCFT equations reduce to the NLS/GPE in the limit: ( \lambda, \beta \rightarrow 0 ), ( \rho \rightarrow \rho_0 ).
* **Milestone 2:** Define conditions under which CE-NWE approximates the linear wave equation.
* **Milestone 3:** Introduce and verify conserved Noether quantities from the Lagrangians.

#### 2. Constraint + Verification Stack

**Goal:** Strengthen gatekeeping between symbolic structure, behavior, and formal validation.

* **Milestone 1:** Add Lean predicates:

  * `PlaneWaveEigen(Op2D) : Prop`
  * `DispersionCompatible(Op2D) : Prop`
* **Milestone 2:** Prove lemma: If ( Op = Op_1 + Op_2 ), then ( \omega_{Op} = \omega_{Op_1} + \omega_{Op_2} ), hence constraint survival implies additive closure.
* **Milestone 3:** Write Python tests for phase, translation, and rotation invariance (pass/fail/undecided regime).

* **Milestone 4:** Express “candidate pruning” explicitly:

  * Build candidate tables for each criterion/bridge.
  * Add one lock per candidate family that can eliminate a family under a stated regime.

#### 3. Interpretability + Mapping

**Goal:** Build a minimal symbolic-to-empirical dictionary.

* **Milestone 1:** Define a lookup table:

  * ( \rho \mapsto ) energy density or probability amplitude.
  * ( \xi \mapsto ) healing length (compare to BEC systems).
  * ( c_{\text{eff}} \mapsto ) sound speed (match to acoustic metrics).
* **Milestone 2:** Map bright/dark solitons to bound state analogs; extract effective mass or decay length.
* **Milestone 3:** Define testable surrogate observable: e.g., decay time ( \tau ) of a vortex pair in coherence gradient flow.

#### 4. Computational Behavior

**Goal:** Validate model stability and behavior under numerical simulation.

* **Milestone 1:** Run simulations of CE-NWE and CP-NLSE for soliton and vortex solutions across grid sizes.
* **Milestone 2:** Measure conservation (mass, energy) under time evolution.
* **Milestone 3:** Stress test: perturb initial wavepacket and track response for different ( \lambda, \beta ).

#### 5. Empirical Interface

**Goal:** Anchor symbolic predictions to testable regimes.

* **Milestone 1:** Identify analogous systems (BEC, optical solitons, fluid vortices).
* **Milestone 2:** Generate synthetic observables (dispersion curves, decay profiles) for comparison.
  Use artifacts and bridges end-to-end:

  * DR-01 fit artifact → BR-01 metric output → downstream prediction
  * Store provenance + data_fingerprint so the chain is reproducible.
* **Milestone 3:** Propose falsifiable claim: "Under fixed ( \lambda_{\text{coh}} ), dark soliton decay occurs within bounded ( \tau ) for ( \rho_0 \in [a,b] )."

This roadmap delivers a coherent path to rigorously test, validate, and begin bridging symbolic structures with observable, testable predictions, using only your verified field content and formal workflow structure.

Let me know which module or milestone you’d like scaffolded or translated into active code first.
