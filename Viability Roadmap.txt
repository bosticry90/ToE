**Unified Roadmap for Viability Advancement**

STATUS: ACTIVE (needs periodic revision)

Non-negotiable guardrails (workflow + science preservation):

- Roadmap text does not create locks.
- Roadmap text does not enable gates or alter admissibility pruning.
- Interpretive mappings are Spec-backed and must not influence FN pruning or enforcement logic.
- All milestones are status-scoped planning targets; no epistemic upgrades occur by writing them.
- No empirical validation performed.

Tooling maturity update (current reality):

- State_of_the_Theory.md is authoritative; IDs, dependencies, and evidence paths are enforced.
- Bridges use front-door APIs with candidate tables + import bans.
- Empirical artifacts exist (typed, fingerprinted fit objects) and are the only allowed bridge inputs.
- Behavioral locks (roundtrip/probe-relative) are treated as guardrails, not global proofs.

Recommended framing (discriminative science loops):

Loop template:
1) Define/collect a minimal empirical artifact (e.g., DR-01 fit artifact with data_fingerprint)
2) Push it through a bridge (e.g., BR-01 metric output)
3) Predict an observable signature under candidate family Y
4) Compare to data/anchor Z (or internal invariance locks)
5) Prune/eliminate candidates (FN pruning) and record the surviving set + evidence

### I. Roadmap to Advance Each Layer

#### 1. Formal Field Architecture

**Goal:** Ensure derivability, reduction, and consistency of field equations.

* **Milestone 1:** Prove that CRFT/CCFT equations reduce to the NLS/GPE in the limit: ( \lambda, \beta \rightarrow 0 ), ( \rho \rightarrow \rho_0 ).
* **Milestone 2:** Define conditions under which CE-NWE approximates the linear wave equation.
* **Milestone 3:** Introduce and verify conserved Noether quantities from the Lagrangians.

#### 2. Constraint + Verification Stack

**Goal:** Strengthen gatekeeping between symbolic structure, behavior, and formal validation.

* **Milestone 1:** Add Lean predicates:

  * `PlaneWaveEigen(Op2D) : Prop`
  * `DispersionCompatible(Op2D) : Prop`
* **Milestone 2:** Prove lemma: If ( Op = Op_1 + Op_2 ), then ( \omega_{Op} = \omega_{Op_1} + \omega_{Op_2} ), hence constraint survival implies additive closure.
* **Milestone 3:** Write Python tests for phase, translation, and rotation invariance (pass/fail/undecided regime).

  * Add Observability / representation-invariance audit (OV-OBS-01): ensure observable outputs do not depend on unobservable metadata (provenance strings, tags).
  * Add Graph/Fourier mode consistency audit (OV-FG-01): cross-check continuum Fourier reasoning vs discrete (graph/lattice) spectral modes.
  * Add many-body trend audit scaffold (OV-MB-01): orthogonality catastrophe overlap trend under local perturbation (toy model only).
  * Add phase-transition window detector (OV-PT-01): detect hexatic-style two-step transition signature on supplied order-parameter curves.
  * Add quantum geometry audit scaffold (OV-QC-01): Berry curvature / Chern number primitive for simplified lattice models.

* **Milestone 4:** Express “candidate pruning” explicitly:

  * Build candidate tables for each criterion/bridge.
  * Add one lock per candidate family that can eliminate a family under a stated regime.

#### 3. Interpretability + Mapping

**Goal:** Build a minimal symbolic-to-empirical dictionary.

* **Milestone 1:** Record a non-binding mapping registry (MAP-01).

  - Status: Spec-backed
  - Enforced by pipeline: No
  - Role: Interpretive aid only (must not affect admissibility or pruning)
* **Milestone 2:** Map bright/dark solitons to bound state analogs; extract effective mass or decay length.
* **Milestone 3:** Define testable surrogate observable: e.g., decay time ( \tau ) of a vortex pair in coherence gradient flow.


Speculative intake quarantine (documentation-only; no core integration)

- Brain–ZPF resonance and vacuum-resonance force-unification proposals remain Hypothesis unless/until distinct, testable predictions are provisioned.
- Any exploratory code in these directions must remain togglable, non-core, and must not alter locks/gates or candidate pruning.

#### 4. Computational Behavior

**Goal:** Validate model stability and behavior under numerical simulation.

* **Milestone 1:** Run simulations of CE-NWE and CP-NLSE for soliton and vortex solutions across grid sizes.
* **Milestone 2:** Measure conservation (mass, energy) under time evolution.
* **Milestone 3:** Stress test: perturb initial wavepacket and track response for different ( \lambda, \beta ).

#### 5. Empirical Interface

**Goal:** Anchor symbolic predictions to testable regimes.

* **Milestone 1:** Identify analogous systems (BEC, optical solitons, fluid vortices).
* **Milestone 2:** Generate synthetic observables (dispersion curves, decay profiles) for comparison.
  Use artifacts and bridges end-to-end:

  * DR-01 fit artifact → BR-01 metric output → downstream prediction
  * Store provenance + data_fingerprint so the chain is reproducible.
* **Milestone 3:** Propose exactly one proxy falsifiable claim (EMP-01), explicitly labeled:

  EMP-01 (Proxy Claim)
  Status: Hypothesis
  Claim: Under fixed lambda_coh, dark soliton decay time tau is bounded for rho0 in [a,b].
  Evidence: Synthetic simulation only
  Notes: No empirical validation performed.

### II. MAP-01 — Symbolic → Empirical Dictionary (Non-binding)

ID: MAP-01
Status: Spec-backed
Role: Interpretive aid only
Enforced by pipeline: No
Notes: Must not feed into FN pruning or admissibility gating.

Registry (tentative mappings):

- rho: energy density OR probability amplitude proxy (context-dependent)
- theta: phase (fluid/quantum analog; non-binding)
- v := d_x theta: velocity-field analog (non-binding)
- c_eff: effective sound speed proxy (acoustic analog)
- lambda_coh: coherence stiffness / penalty scale (no external anchor yet)
- bright soliton: localized bound-state analog (interpretive only)
- vortex pair / dark soliton: defect or excitation analog (interpretive only)

### III. Lean Test Battery for Core Derivations

#### Module: OperatorSignature.lean

```lean

predicate PlaneWaveEigen (O : Op2D) : Prop :=
\u2200 k, \u2203 \mu, O (e^{ikx}) = \mu(k) * e^{ikx}

predicate DispersionCompatible (O : Op2D) : Prop :=
\u2200 k, \mu(k) = k^2 + \lambda k^4 + \beta k^6  -- example

  PlaneWaveEigen O1 \u2227 PlaneWaveEigen O2 \u2227 DispersionCompatible O1 \u2227 DispersionCompatible O2 \u2192
  DispersionCompatible (O1 + O2)
```

#### Module: ConservationLaws.lean

```lean

def Mass(\phi : Field2D) : \u2115 := ...

lemma energy_conserved:
\u2200 \phi_t : Field2D, evolves_under_CP_NLSE \phi_t \u2192 Energy(\phi_t) = const

lemma mass_conserved:
\u2200 \phi_t : Field2D, evolves_under_CP_NLSE \phi_t \u2192 Mass(\phi_t) = const
```

#### Module: CoherencePenalty.lean

```lean
def CoherencePenalty(\rho : Field2D) := \u222b (\rho - \rho_0)^2 dx

lemma zero_penalty_when_uniform:
\u2200 \rho, (\rho = \rho_0) \u2192 CoherencePenalty(\rho) = 0
```

This roadmap delivers a coherent path to rigorously test, validate, and begin bridging symbolic structures with observable, testable predictions, using only your verified field content and formal workflow structure.

Let me know which module or milestone you’d like scaffolded or translated into active code first.
