\# Fundamental Theory (FT) Program



This directory will contain models and derivations for a proposed fundamental

description from which the validated scalar-coherence field theory emerges

as an effective low-energy limit.



The FT program is constrained by:



\- The canonical equations and invariants in `../docs/state\_of\_the\_theory.md`

\- The numerical behavior of solitons, vortices, and coherent structures in `field\_theory/`

\- Symmetry and conservation requirements identified in Noether and hydrodynamic analyses



Subdirectories:



\- `models/`       — candidate fundamental models and algebraic structures

\- `gpu/`          — GPU kernels and simulations at the fundamental level

\- `derivations/`  — symbolic derivations and reduction maps to field theory

\- `invariants/`   — FT-level invariants and their relation to field-theory invariants

\- `tests/`        — unit and integration tests for FT

\- `results/`      — numerical experiments, scans, and diagnostics



No FT content is yet authoritative until it is:

1\. Consistent with `../docs/state\_of\_the\_theory.md`, and

2\. Validated numerically against `field\_theory/` observables.
