\# Part I — Conceptual Foundations of the Classical Coherence Field Theory (CCFT)



\## 1. Overview of CCFT as a Unified Classical Field Framework



The Classical Coherence Field Theory (CCFT) is a unified nonlinear classical field theory that integrates multiple dynamical subsystems into one coherent mathematical structure. CCFT combines:



1\. The CP–NLSE first-order coherence-preserving nonlinear Schrödinger equation.

2\. The CE–NWE second-order coherence-extended nonlinear wave equation.

3\. The LCRD rotor–curvature subsystem describing local coherence distortions.

4\. The φ–χ multi-field extension introducing additional coupled degrees of freedom.



Together, these subsystems describe density, velocity, coherence, dispersion, and structural distortions within a single nonlinear classical theory. CCFT is not a quantum theory. Its goal is to form a mesoscopic classical layer with tightly organized dynamics from which coherent structures, dispersive waves, and multi-field interactions emerge in a mathematically consistent manner.



\## 2. Motivating Principles Behind CCFT



\### 2.1 Coherence as a Dynamical Quantity



The governing idea of CCFT is that coherence is not a static property but a quantity that evolves dynamically in response to gradients, nonlinear interactions, dispersion, and microstructural distortions. The theory models how coherent features persist, decay, or transform across space and time.



\### 2.2 Dispersion as the Unifying Mechanism



All CCFT subsystems share a common dispersion structure derived from LSDA microphysical calibration. This ensures that the first-order and second-order formulations are consistent with each other, the rotor–curvature dynamics remain compatible with the core equations, and the φ–χ extension does not introduce contradictory behaviors.



\### 2.3 Structured Energy Functionals



Each subsystem is supported by a well-defined energy functional. These functionals determine allowable field configurations, stabilize the dynamics, and support theoretical and numerical closure. Quadratic energy terms appear in the rotor sector, kinetic and potential energy terms appear in second-order systems, and LSDA-derived nonlinear energy contributions appear in the CP–NLSE and CE–NWE branches.



\## 3. Subsystem Foundations and Rationale



\### 3.1 CP–NLSE Subsystem



\#### Purpose

The CP–NLSE governs the primary complex coherence field. It controls density through the amplitude, velocity through the phase gradient, and nonlinear self-interaction through the LSDA-calibrated coupling \\( g\_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\).



\#### Why a first-order equation

The first-order form is chosen because it provides accurate coherent transport, simple coupling to hydrodynamic variables, and stability under dispersion-dominated regimes.



\#### Why λ = 0 and β = 0 in CCFT

These higher-order nonlinear corrections are intentionally omitted to preserve minimal LSDA-calibrated dynamics and avoid introducing additional dispersion or steepening terms that are not supported by microphysical analysis.



\#### How LSDA determines \\( g\_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\)

LSDA computes effective nonlinear coupling from local structure–density relationships. This mapping directly produces the constant \\( g\_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\) that appears in both the first-order and second-order CCFT branches.



\### 3.2 CE–NWE Subsystem



\#### Purpose

CE–NWE is the second-order formulation equivalent to CP–NLSE. It captures inertial and oscillatory features that are less transparent in first-order form.



\#### Why second-order dynamics matter

Second-order equations provide a classical interpretation of acceleration, wave propagation, and elastic-like responses. These behaviors become important when analyzing φ–χ interactions or rotor backreaction.



\#### Why CE–NWE is not a different physical model

It is mathematically equivalent to CP–NLSE through standard transformations. Both share the same dispersion relation, invariants, and nonlinear structure.



\#### How dispersion unifies both branches

Because the dispersion relation is shared, solitons, wave packets, modulational instability properties, and perturbative modes are identical across both formulations.



\### 3.3 LCRD Subsystem



\#### Purpose

The LCRD subsystem introduces the fields R and K to describe LSDA-identified microstructural distortions, specifically rotational coherence and curvature-like effects.



\#### Why R and K exist

LSDA reveals coarse-grained microstructural features that cannot be captured by density and phase alone. R represents rotational coherence distortions, while K represents curvature or bending-like distortions.



\#### Why rotor energy is quadratic

The form \\( \\frac{c\_1}{2}R^2 + \\frac{c\_2}{2}K^2 \\) provides the simplest energy penalty that stabilizes these fields and matches LSDA-derived microphysical energetics.



\#### Why rotor effects modify momentum but not continuity

Mass conservation does not depend on microstructural distortion. Rotor effects influence momentum flux through a pressure-like correction term \\( Q\_{\\mathrm{rotor}} \\), but they do not alter continuity dynamics.



\### 3.4 φ–χ Multi-Field Extension



\#### Purpose

The φ–χ extension tests CCFT’s ability to support multi-field couplings while preserving stability and coherence properties. It introduces a new second-order field χ weakly coupled to the first-order φ field.



\#### Why χ is included

The χ field models additional elastic-like or structural modes not representable by the single complex field φ.



\#### Why coupling is weak

Weak coupling ensures that φ’s coherence-preserving structure remains intact while allowing χ to influence the system without destabilizing it.



\#### Why χ is second-order while φ is first-order

φ carries coherent transport, while χ introduces inertial or restorative dynamics. This asymmetry reflects their distinct physical roles.



\#### Why this preserves CCFT limits

When couplings vanish, φ returns to standard CP–NLSE/CE–NWE behavior and χ becomes a decoupled wave equation. The extension therefore generalizes rather than replaces CCFT.
