Recommended Structure for Your CCFT Research Monograph



A scientifically credible monograph for your background and intentions should be organized as follows:



Front Matter



Title



Abstract



Author statement



Disclaimer about independent research



Summary of contributions



High-level roadmap



Part I — Conceptual Foundations



Motivation



The role of coherence in classical field theories



Relationship to LSDA microphysics



Overview of subsystems: CP–NLSE, CE–NWE, LCRD, φ–χ



The rationale for CCFT as a single field theory

Spectral turbulence



Part VII — Pathways Toward Unification



This is essential given your ToE motivation.



Explain:



Why CCFT is classical



How coherence provides a mesoscopic bridge



How quantization might emerge



What a relativistic extension might require



Where CCFT may connect to quantum field theory, cosmology, or geometric physics



Appendices



Full derivations



Operator identities



Test tables



Code references



Nondimensionalization



Symbol glossary



6\. Recommended Structure for the Companion Summary Article



This document must be far shorter and more direct.



Sections:



Motivation



Summary of CCFT equations



Explanation of subsystems



Numerical validation overview



Scientific significance



Future work



This is what you submit to preprint servers or conferences.



7\. Final Recommendation



Given everything:



You should produce a research monograph as your primary publication, accompanied by a concise summary article.



This:



showcases rigor,



positions you credibly,



matches academic expectations for new theoretical frameworks,



aligns with your computational physics work,



provides the proper foundation for future ToE development.
