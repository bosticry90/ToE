\# Phase 3 — Gate checks (hard stop if failure)



\*\*Scope locked from Phase-1\*\*: amplitude-gradient coherence only; ε-regularization applied wherever |φ| appears in denominators. Units per Phase-0.



G1) \*\*Dimensional closure\*\*

\- Every term in ℒ and ℋ has unit L·T⁻² (1D).

\- (EOM-φ), (CONT), (DISP) dimensionally consistent in physical and natural units.



G2) \*\*Complex ↔ real-symplectic equivalence\*\*

\- Hamilton’s equations from ℋ(q,p) combine to the complex EOM-φ, up to the |φ|→|φ|ₑ convention.



G3) \*\*Positivity/coercivity\*\*

\- ℋ ≥ ∫U\_min dx; coherence term ≥0 for λ≥0.

\- For convex U near ρ₀, small-amplitude energy is positive definite.



G4) \*\*Conservation laws\*\*

\- Noether (time translation) ⇒ dH/dt = 0 for periodic BC.

\- Integrate (CONT) over Ω: d/dt ∫ρ dx = 0.



Acceptance: all four gates pass or Phase-3 stops.
