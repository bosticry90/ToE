STATUS: ARCHIVED (implemented)

Implemented via DAG enforcement, front-door bridges, and artifact provenance checks.
Kept for governance justification and historical context.

Practical action plan (commit-sized, no new tools)
Commit 1 — Add circularity detection

Add formal/python/tests/test_state_theory_dag.py:

parse inventory IDs + dependencies

fail on cycles, missing IDs, missing evidence paths

Commit 2 — Add Definition Change Record enforcement

Add formal/markdown/dcr/README.md and enforce:

any change under ToeFormal/**/Definitions or EQ-* requires a DCR entry

Commit 3 — Add “conditionality labeling” enforcement

Add a simple grep-based Python test:

if a Lean file imports PlaneWaveOperatorAxioms, require theorem names contain _conditional or have explicit axiom hypotheses

Commit 4 — Lock Aristotle usage (if you keep it)

Create formal/toe_formal/ToeFormal/Prove/ as the only Aristotle-facing directory.

Policy: no new defs/axioms there; only sorry filling.

The key mitigation for circular fixes

Your system becomes stable when you make it easier to fail fast than to patch:

Definition changes must be declared (DCR).

Inventory must match artifacts.

DAG must remain acyclic.

Axioms must remain quarantined.

Python fixes must be test-driven (red → green).

If you want, paste one recent example of a “circular fix loop” (what broke, what you changed, what broke next). I will classify it into one of the 5 root causes above and map it to the specific gate that would have prevented it.
