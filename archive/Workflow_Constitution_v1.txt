Workflow Constitution

1️⃣ Markdown = Intent Authority

What Markdown is allowed to say:
Definitions (conceptual)
Claims (tagged as conjecture / hypothesis / locked)
Interpretations
Motivation
Scope and limits

What Markdown is not allowed to do:
Assert correctness
Claim necessity
Imply proof
Blur empirical vs formal

Markdown never proves. It only intends.

2️⃣ Python = Behavioral Authority

What Python is allowed to say:
“This equation behaves this way under these conditions”
“Numerical error < ε”
“Stability observed”
“Dispersion matches predicted slope”

What Python is not allowed to say:
“Therefore this must be true”
“Therefore the structure is correct”

Python answers:
“Does the model do what the theory expects?”

3️⃣ Lean = Structural Authority

What Lean is allowed to say:
Definitions are unambiguous
Identities are exact
Reductions are valid
Dependencies are explicit
No hidden assumptions exist

What Lean is not allowed to say:
“This models reality”
“This is physically correct”

Lean answers:
“If we accept these definitions, nothing contradicts itself.”

4️⃣ Aristotle = Translator, not judge

Aristotle:
Never introduces new claims
Never upgrades confidence
Never replaces reasoning

It only:
Moves intent → structure
Moves verified behavior → formal lemma
Eliminates syntactic friction

Constraint Admission Rule (CAR-01)

Rule (binding):
No new constraint, criterion, or admissibility rule may enter the theory unless it has all three layers:

Minimal baseline

A narrowly scoped regime with a sharp, testable signature

Explicit scope limits (e.g., linearized, probe-relative, small-amplitude)

Formal gate (Lean)

Structural definition of what is preserved vs broken

Explicit dependencies and axioms

No behavioral or physical claims

Behavioral consequence (Python)

A predicted, directionally specific effect when the gate is violated

A null effect when the gate is satisfied (within stated limits)

Enforcement mechanism:

Markdown proposals that lack any one layer are invalid by default.

Lean modules may not be introduced without a corresponding inventory entry.

Python evidence may not upgrade status; it only satisfies the “consequence” leg.
