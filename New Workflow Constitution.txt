STATUS: ACTIVE / AUTHORITATIVE

New Workflow Constitution (Lean-First)

This is the sole active constitution for this repository.
Supersedes: archive/Workflow_Constitution_v1.txt

1️⃣ Lean = Primary Authority (Structure + Intent)

Lean files may contain three layers:

A. Structural Authority (binding)

Definitions

Axioms (explicitly labeled)

Lemmas

Theorems

Dependency graph

This layer defines:

What exists and what follows from it

B. Intent Authority (non-binding, internal)

Lean docstrings (/- … -/) may state:

Motivation

Design intent

Scope restrictions

Why a definition exists

These:

do not assert truth

do not upgrade status

cannot cause circular validation

They are comments, not claims.

C. Gate Definitions (structural only)

Constraints (CT-01, SYM-01, CAUS-01):

are predicates

have no physical meaning

only say “admissible / not admissible”

Lean answers:

“If you accept these definitions, the exclusions are logically sound.”


2️⃣ Empirical Artifacts = Typed, Fingerprinted Inputs

Empirical Artifacts are typed, provenance-carrying objects (e.g., DR-01 fit artifacts)
that serve as the only allowed inputs to bridge layers.

Rules (binding):

- No bridge may consume raw data files, raw numpy arrays, or untyped tuples as its primary input.
- Fit artifacts must be provenance-stamped (source kind/ref + fit method tag) and carry a
	content-based fingerprint (e.g., a hash of a canonical (k, ω) sample).
- Library bridge code must not read files implicitly; any file IO / hashing happens at artifact
	creation time (scripts/tools), not inside bridge modules.


3️⃣ Bridges = Front-Door Only (Constitutional)

Any bridge criterion must expose exactly one canonical callable (“front door”).

Rules (binding):

- Downstream consumers import only the front door.
- All candidate implementations live in private/internal modules, are tabled explicitly,
	are regression-tested (locks), and are import-banned downstream.
- Candidate tables are completeness-checked (no missing, no stale entries).

4️⃣ Python = Consequence Engine

Python is never discovery-first.

Allowed:

“If this gate fails, X grows / shifts / destabilizes”

“If satisfied, effect is null within ε”

Disallowed:

“Therefore this structure is correct”

Python answers:

“Does violating the structure cause the predicted effect?”

5️⃣ Markdown = Optional Externalization Layer

Markdown becomes:

explanatory

narrative

human-readable

Markdown cannot:

define admissibility

gate Lean

introduce constraints

Markdown is now:

A rendered view of Lean + Python, not a peer authority.

This removes circularity.

6️⃣ Aristotle = One-Way Adapter

Aristotle may:

translate Lean intent comments into clearer Lean structure

convert Python invariants into lemmas

eliminate boilerplate

Aristotle may never:

introduce constraints

modify inventory status

justify correctness


Progress Without Completion (Explicit)

Reductions, Noether derivations, and empirical anchoring may be partial, scoped, or probe-relative
without blocking progress.

Allowed (if scope is explicit):

- Probe-relative theorems and locks
- Structural wrappers that preserve dependency discipline
- Behavioral evidence that tightens a lock without claiming global validity

Disallowed:

- Silent scope creep (changing what a result claims without changing its stated scope)
- Upgrading status based on behavioral tests alone

Where We Are Right Now (Clear State)

Locked / Stable

CT-01 (dispersion preservation gate)

SYM-01 (symmetry pruning)

CAUS-01 (structural causality admissibility)

Plane-wave operator scaffold

Probe-relative dispersion logic

Resolved

DR-02 anchoring confusion (correctly separated claim vs evidence)

Archive vs canonical evidence ambiguity

Structural vs behavioral overclaiming

Not Blocked

No foundational contradictions

No failed gates

No refuted claims
