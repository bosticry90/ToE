Purpose
This file establishes what exists in the weakest possible sense.
It intentionally does not describe how anything behaves, changes, or is interpreted.
This file exists to test whether the project’s core idea can be stated clearly and without contradiction.

1. Existence of a domain
There exists a domain.
The domain is the setting in which the system is defined.
No assumptions are made about:
    • dimension,
    • geometry,
    • continuity,
    • discreteness,
    • time,
    • or physical meaning.
The domain is only required to exist.

2. Existence of a varying quantity
There exists a quantity associated with the domain.
This quantity can take different values across the domain.
No assumptions are made about:
    • what the quantity represents,
    • how it is measured,
    • whether it is scalar, vectorial, or otherwise structured.
The only requirement is that different configurations of the quantity are distinguishable.

3. Distinguishability of configurations
Different configurations of the quantity are not all identical.
It is meaningful to say that one configuration differs from another.
No preference, ordering, stability, or evaluation of configurations is assumed.

4. Scope and limitations
This file does not define:
    • rules,
    • evolution,
    • dynamics,
    • equations,
    • coherence,
    • stability,
    • or interpretation.
Those concepts, if introduced, must be defined in later files and must remain consistent with this one.

Status
This file satisfies Axiom 1 of the project.
If this file cannot be stated clearly or without contradiction, the hypothesis is rejected according to the README.
