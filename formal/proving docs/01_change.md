01_change.md
Purpose
This file establishes what is meant by change in the system.
It defines change only as a relation between configurations, not as a process in time, not as a rule of evolution, and not as a physical mechanism.
This file exists to test whether the concept of change can be introduced without contradiction or hidden assumptions.

1. Configurations
A configuration is a complete assignment of values of the quantity across the domain.
Configurations are the objects being compared when discussing change.
No structure, ordering, or preference among configurations is assumed.

2. Definition of change
Change is defined as non-identity between configurations.
Given two configurations:
    • If they are identical, no change has occurred.
    • If they differ, change is said to exist between them.
Change does not imply:
    • direction,
    • cause,
    • duration,
    • rate,
    • or mechanism.
It only asserts that difference is possible.

3. Relational nature of change
Change is a relation between configurations, not a property of a single configuration.
It is meaningful to compare configurations and state whether they are the same or different.
No assumption is made that configurations are connected by a continuous path or sequence.

4. Absence of time
This file does not assume the existence of time.
Change does not imply:
    • before or after,
    • past or future,
    • evolution,
    • or motion.
Time, if introduced, must be defined later and must be consistent with this relational definition of change.

5. Scope and limitations
This file does not define:
    • rules governing change,
    • allowed or preferred changes,
    • dynamics or evolution,
    • stability or coherence,
    • equations of motion.
Those concepts, if introduced, must build on this definition without contradicting it.

Status
This file builds on 00_existence.md and introduces change in the weakest possible sense.
If the concept of change cannot be defined without importing time, dynamics, or interpretation, the hypothesis is rejected according to the README.
