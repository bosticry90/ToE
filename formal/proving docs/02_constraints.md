Purpose
This file establishes what is meant by constraints on change.
Constraints are introduced only as conditions on which changes are allowed or disallowed, not as rules that generate change, select change, or explain how change occurs.
This file exists to test whether the idea that “consistency matters” can be stated without importing dynamics, time, or interpretation.

1. Changes as admissible or inadmissible
Not all differences between configurations are necessarily allowed.
A constraint is a condition that classifies a change between two configurations as:
    • admissible, or
    • inadmissible.
No claim is made that admissible changes occur, are preferred, or are realized.
The constraint only distinguishes possibility from impossibility.

2. Constraint as a condition on pairs of configurations
A constraint applies to a pair of configurations.
Given two configurations:
    • the constraint may be satisfied, or
    • the constraint may be violated.
The constraint does not:
    • order configurations,
    • rank changes,
    • measure change,
    • or define a path between configurations.

3. Independence from time and process
Constraints do not depend on:
    • time,
    • sequence,
    • history,
    • causation,
    • or process.
A constraint does not say:
    • which configuration comes first,
    • how one configuration leads to another,
    • or whether a change actually happens.
It only states whether a difference is allowed.

4. Independence from preference or optimization
Constraints do not imply:
    • preference,
    • stability,
    • optimality,
    • or minimization.
No configuration is assumed to be “better,” “worse,” or “more coherent.”
Those notions, if introduced later, must be defined in terms consistent with this constraint-only role.

5. Minimality of constraints
Constraints must be:
    • explicitly stated,
    • finite in number,
    • and independent of interpretation.
A constraint that exists only to rescue a desired outcome is not permitted.
If meaningful structure requires an ever-growing set of constraints, the hypothesis is rejected according to the README.

6. Scope and limitations
This file does not define:
    • dynamics or evolution,
    • equations of motion,
    • rates or laws,
    • stability criteria,
    • coherence measures,
    • or physical meaning.
Constraints introduced here are static conditions only.

Status
This file introduces constraints on change consistent with:
    • 00_existence.md,
    • 01_change.md,
    • and the README.
If constraints cannot be stated without becoming rules of evolution or optimization, the hypothesis is rejected according to the README.
