\*\*Classical Coherence Field Theory (CCFT):

A Unified Classical Multiscale Nonlinear Field Framework Derived from LSDA Microphysics\*\*

\## Abstract



Classical Coherence Field Theory (CCFT) is a unified classical field framework that integrates three mathematically compatible subsystems into a single, coherent, nonlinear dispersive theory. Its foundation is the Coherence-Regularized Field Theory (CRFT), which includes the first-order CP–NLSE branch and the mathematically equivalent second-order CE–NWE branch. These two branches together define the primary continuum dynamics of coherence, dispersion, and hydrodynamic reduction.



CCFT incorporates the Local Coherence Rotor Dynamics (LCRD) subsystem to describe mesoscopic microstructure via the rotor field \\(R(x,t)\\) and curvature field \\(K(x,t)\\). These fields arise from empirical analysis of LSDA microphysics, where short-wavelength oscillations and curvature-dependent effects consistently appear in numerical experiments. The LCRD subsystem provides a rotor-induced pressure correction in the momentum equation through a quadratic energy functional, ensuring stable and physically interpretable mesoscopic behavior.



CCFT also includes a controlled multi-field generalization through the \\(\\phi\\)–\\(\\chi\\) extension. The \\(\\phi\\) field retains the CP–NLSE dynamics, while the auxiliary \\(\\chi\\) field evolves through a second-order dispersive operator. Weak coupling between the fields enables secondary coherence channels, curvature-responsive behavior, and controlled energy exchange without violating the core CRFT structure or destabilizing the theory.



The governing equations of CCFT are calibrated through the Local Sound–Density Approximation (LSDA), which determines effective parameters such as \\(g\_{\\text{eff}} = 9.8696\\), \\(\\rho\_0 = 1.0\\), and \\(\\nu\_{\\text{eff}}\\). This grounding ensures that the continuum-level theory reflects the microphysical behaviors observed in LSDA simulations, including soliton dynamics, dispersion relations, coherence structures, and rotor–curvature interactions.



This monograph presents the complete mathematical development of the unified CCFT framework, including subsystem rationales, derivations of governing equations, functional variations, dispersion analyses, hydrodynamic reductions, operator identities, and equivalence proofs between first-order and second-order formulations. Numerical methods and validation procedures are documented in detail. The validation suite includes the CRFT core tests (C1–C13), LCRD rotor–curvature closure tests (L1–L10), the \\(\\phi\\)–\\(\\chi\\) multifield tests, and high-level geometric and turbulence diagnostics. These demonstrate stability, coherence, dispersion fidelity, subsystem compatibility, and closure consistency across the entire CCFT structure.



The document concludes with an explicit analysis of how CCFT operates as a classical mesoscopic layer that may support upward theoretical extensions. It explains why CCFT is deliberately classical, how coherent structures could form the basis for emergent quantization, and how the mathematical structure of CCFT may eventually interface with relativistic or cosmological models. The result is a unified classical theory that is internally consistent, mathematically explicit, empirically calibrated, and suitable for future integration into broader theoretical frameworks.

\## High-Level Roadmap of the Monograph



The structure of the monograph is organized into seven primary parts, each building logically from microphysical origins to continuum formulations, subsystem integration, numerical validation, and larger-scale interpretive frameworks:



1\. \*\*Part I — Conceptual Foundations\*\*

   Introduces the motivation for CCFT, the role of coherence in classical field theories, the relationship to LSDA microphysics, and an overview of CCFT subsystems.



2\. \*\*Part II — Mathematical Structure of CCFT\*\*

   Presents the full CP–NLSE and CE–NWE derivations, subsystem rationales, governing equations, hydrodynamic reductions, equivalence proofs, rotor–curvature dynamics, and multifield extensions.



3\. \*\*Part III — Functional Principles\*\*

   Provides energy functionals, variational calculations, symmetries, conserved quantities, and stability analyses.



4\. \*\*Part IV — Numerical Implementation\*\*

   Documents discretization strategies, spectral operators, timestep schemes, diagnostic methods, error-control strategies, and reproducibility considerations.



5\. \*\*Part V — Validation and Verification\*\*

   Explains the purpose and significance of each test family, interprets test results, and demonstrates subsystem compatibility, dispersion fidelity, and stability.



6\. \*\*Part VI — Physical Interpretation and Applications\*\*

   Discusses solitons, rotor structures, coherent phenomena, hydrodynamic and geometric analogues, and turbulent spectral regimes.



7\. \*\*Part VII — Pathways Toward Unification\*\*

   Explains why CCFT is deliberately classical, how coherence and structured dynamics could support emergent quantization, and how CCFT may serve as a mesoscopic layer between microphysical models and relativistic or cosmological frameworks.



Each part is written explicitly and is mathematically self-contained. Together, they form a complete presentation of the Classical Coherence Field Theory as a unified classical nonlinear field framework.
