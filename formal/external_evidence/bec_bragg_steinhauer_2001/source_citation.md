TITLE: External Evidence Packet — BEC Bragg Spectroscopy (Steinhauer et al. 2001/2002)

FROZEN TARGET
Primary dataset: Steinhauer et al., “The Excitation Spectrum of a Bose–Einstein Condensate”

* arXiv preprint: cond-mat/0111438 (posted 22 Nov 2001)
* Journal publication: Physical Review Letters 88, 120407 (2002), DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.120407

WHAT IS USED (EXACTLY)

* Figure: Fig. 3(a) excitation spectrum ω(k)
* Axes: horizontal k (μm^-1), vertical ω(k)/(2π) (kHz)
* Data: filled circles in Fig. 3(a)
* Theory curve reference: caption states solid line is Bogoliubov spectrum in the LDA for μ = 1.91 kHz (no free parameters); dashed line is free-particle spectrum.

WHY THIS IS A CLEAN ANCHOR

* Bragg spectroscopy directly measures excitation resonance ω(k) at imposed momentum k.
* Fig. 3(a) spans phonon-like (low k) and particle-like (high k) regimes.
* The paper explicitly compares the measured spectrum to Bogoliubov theory (LDA).

SCOPE LIMITATIONS

* Trapped condensate; comparison is within Local Density Approximation domain.
* Digitized points are a reproducible extraction from the plotted figure; replace with author-provided numeric data if obtained.

EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS

* This packet does not claim validation of beyond-mean-field effects.
* This packet does not test finite-temperature corrections.
* This packet does not test trap-induced mode discretization beyond the LDA assumption.
* This packet does not validate nonlinear dynamics outside the linearized excitation regime.
