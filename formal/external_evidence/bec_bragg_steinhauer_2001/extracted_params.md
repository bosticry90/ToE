TITLE: Extracted Experimental Parameters — Steinhauer et al. BEC Bragg Spectrum

PRIMARY PARAMETER USED FOR THEORY COMPARISON
Chemical potential used in Fig. 3(a) Bogoliubov curve:

* μ/(h) = 1.91 kHz  (caption parameter for the “no free parameters” Bogoliubov spectrum)

OBSERVABLES

* Measured: ω(k)/(2π) in kHz as a function of k in μm^-1 (Fig. 3(a))

SCOPE

* Parameters apply only to Fig. 3(a) excitation spectrum and the Bogoliubov curve shown therein; no claim is made that μ/h = 1.91 kHz applies globally to all experimental conditions in the paper.

UNCERTAINTY NOTES

* Caption indicates that for most points the error bars are not visible on the scale of Fig. 3(a).
* For the evidence packet workflow, we store a conservative placeholder σ\_ω and σ\_k for digitized extraction; these must be replaced by stated experimental uncertainties if (a) the paper text provides them numerically, or (b) author data is obtained.

CONSTANTS USED IN COMPUTATION (DEFAULTS)

* Atomic species mass: m = mass(87Rb) = 1.44316060e-25 kg (CODATA standard value for 87Rb)
* ħ = 1.054571817e-34 J·s
* h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

UNIT CONVENTIONS

* Input k from figure: k \[μm^-1] converted to k \[m^-1] via k\_m = k\_um \* 1e6
* Input μ/h: kHz converted to Hz via (μ/h)\_Hz = (μ/h)\_kHz \* 1e3
* μ = h \* (μ/h)\_Hz
* Theory outputs ω/(2π) in Hz, then converted to kHz

NOTE

* Earlier digitization inconsistencies were resolved by full re-digitization from the arXiv PDF; current dataset contains no excluded points.
* χ² is not physically meaningful until true experimental uncertainties replace placeholders.
