Model relation: c_s = sqrt(μ/m)
c_s(μ) = 0.00296133 m/s
Fit window: k <= 3.2 μm⁻¹ (used 8 points)
c_s,fit = 0.00218712 m/s
Percent difference = -26.1 %
Observable: low-k slope 
dω/dk
dω/dk extracted directly from Bragg resonance data.

WARNINGS
None.

NOTE
χ² is not physically meaningful until true experimental uncertainties replace placeholders; it is reported here only as a consistency diagnostic under a provisional digitization-based σ model.
