# CT-10 Independent External Anchor Intake (TBD)

Planning scaffold only.

Purpose
- Hold intake artifacts for CT-10 candidate selection before any comparator lane exists.
- Enforce independence documentation before admission.
- Keep CT-10 in a non-claim posture until a full lane is implemented.

Minimum required intake contents
- Source citation with explicit source lineage independence statement.
- Dataset metadata with pinned fingerprint fields.
- Preprocessing notes proving no shared preprocessing lineage.
- Explicit statement that the candidate is not BEC-derived.

Policy notes
- No comparator claims are permitted from this folder.
- Any CT-10 activation must pass the selection filter document first:
