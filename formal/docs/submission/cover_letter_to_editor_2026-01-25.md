# Cover letter (draft)

Dear Editor,

We submit “A Failure-Resistant Scientific Comparison Pipeline” as a methodology and governance contribution. This manuscript does not present new domain results or equivalence claims. Instead, it addresses a recurrent failure mode in automated scientific workflows: the tendency to compute comparisons by default when epistemic authorization is absent.

The paper introduces a pipeline architecture in which admissibility is explicit, enforced, and auditable. When authorization is missing, the system deterministically emits a structured refusal (“blocked”) rather than a partial or inferred result. This refusal is treated as a first-class outcome and recorded as a canonical artifact.

To avoid scope ambiguity, the technical specification is frozen and provided as an appendix; the main text is a public-facing wrapper focused on methodology and governance rather than domain claims.

We believe this contribution will be of interest to readers concerned with reproducibility, scientific software governance, and failure-resistant computational workflows.

Sincerely,

[Author]
