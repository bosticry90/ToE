# Venue targeting notes

Date: 2026-01-25

## Primary venue class (recommended)

Reproducibility / scientific computing methods journal or track

Rationale

- Explicitly accepts methods, governance, and workflow papers.
- Comfortable with non-results contributions.
- Familiar with provenance, policy-as-code, and auditability concepts.
- Lowest risk of “where are the physics results?” rejection.

Typical positioning language

- Methods
- Reproducible workflows
- Computational governance
- Scientific software systems

## Backup venue class

Software engineering / scientific software systems venue

Rationale

- Strong tolerance for architecture-first contributions.
- Reviewers understand enforcement vs intent separation.
- Accepts artifact-backed design patterns.

Tradeoff

- May need slightly stronger “scientific relevance” framing in abstract (still non-claiming).
