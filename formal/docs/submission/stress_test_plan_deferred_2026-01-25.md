# Reviewer stress-test plan (deferred)

Date: 2026-01-25
Status: deferred (execute last)

When ready, simulate:

1. Hostile misreading
   - “This is secretly claiming equivalence.”
   - “Blocked means unfinished.”

2. Reviewer scope drift
   - Demands for results.
   - Requests to enable gates.

3. Process attack
   - “Why not just compare anyway?”
   - “Why is refusal better than uncertainty?”

Constraint

- Stress-test output must not introduce new claims.
- Stress-test output must not require edits to frozen v0.2.
