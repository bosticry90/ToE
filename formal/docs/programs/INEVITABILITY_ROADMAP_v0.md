# INEVITABILITY_ROADMAP_v0

## 1. Scope and Intent

This document records the intended progression by which the Theory of Everything (ToE) framework may move from internal regime-limit admissibility (RL program) toward conditional structural inevitability statements.

No claim is made that the described progression will succeed, nor that nature uniquely selects the resulting structures.

This document is normative and programmatic only.

## 2. Definitions

Structural inevitability (conditional):
A property is conditionally inevitable if, given an explicit set of observational anchors and admissibility constraints, any model satisfying those constraints must contain a structure isomorphic to the identified core, up to representation.

Isomorphic up to representation:
Different mathematical or computational representations that preserve the same underlying relational structure and invariants.

## 3. Completed Preconditions

The following prerequisites are declared complete:
- RL01-RL16 regime-limit screening program
- Governance-enforced hard stop at RL16
- Explicit non-claim posture regarding ontology or empirical truth

No further RLs are permitted without revising this roadmap.

## 4. Program Phases (Non-Overlapping)

### Phase A - External Anchors

Objective:
Introduce narrow, explicit reality-contact points that can falsify internal structures.

Constraints:
- Anchors must be public, narrow, and independently checkable.
- Failure cases must be recorded as locked artifacts.

No inevitability claims are permitted in this phase.

### Phase B - Conditional No-Go Theorems (CT Program)

Objective:
Establish internal impossibility results of the form:
If constraints A, B, C hold, then property X is required.

Constraints:
- All theorems must be explicitly conditional.
- No empirical generalization is permitted.
- Dependencies on RLs and anchors must be declared.

### Phase C - Universality and Robustness

Objective:
Test whether identified structures survive changes in representation, discretization, numeric scheme, and admissible dynamics.

Constraints:
- Robustness is evidence, not proof.
- Failures must be preserved.

### Phase D - Representation Invariance

Objective:
Demonstrate that key constraints are independent of coordinate choice, basis, or parametrization.

Constraints:
- Multiple representations must be explicitly enumerated.
- Invariants must be defined operationally.

### Phase E - Minimality Analysis

Objective:
Determine whether identified core constraints are irreducible.

Method:
- Systematically remove constraints.
- Record which anchors or admissibility conditions fail.

### Phase F - Replication Readiness

Objective:
Enable adversarial reproduction of selected results.

Constraints:
- Reproduction packages must be minimal.
- No narrative interpretation is included.

## 5. Explicit Non-Goals

This roadmap does not aim to:
- Prove uniqueness of the universe
- Establish metaphysical necessity
- Replace empirical science
- Assert ontological primacy of any representation

## 6. Governance and Revision

This roadmap may be revised only by:
- explicit version bump,
- doc-gate update,
- and governance-suite approval.
