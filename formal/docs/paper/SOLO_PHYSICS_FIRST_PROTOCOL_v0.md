# Solo Physics-First Protocol v0

Spec ID:
- `SOLO_PHYSICS_FIRST_PROTOCOL_v0`

Classification:
- `P-POLICY`

Purpose:
- Keep pillar execution focused on substantive physics theorem progress.
- Treat governance infrastructure as a constraint layer, not the primary workstream.
- Preserve solo pacing autonomy: no timeline, sprint, cadence, or throughput obligations.

Core operating rules:
1. Physics target first
- Every execution step must name one theorem endpoint and one counterfactual endpoint.
- If neither endpoint advances, do not treat the step as closure progress.

2. Governance lock by default
- Do not create new governance artifacts unless theorem-body changes require synchronization.
- Preferred order: theorem-body change -> substance test -> minimal required canonical sync.

3. Substance tests only
- New tests should enforce theorem-body content (required dependency calls, endpoint failure logic, anti-shortcut route purity).
- Avoid adding tests that only enforce wording/format/layout unless drift causes theorem-surface ambiguity.

4. Counterfactual requirement
- Each inevitability route step must include a theorem showing endpoint failure when a required dependency is removed.

5. Independent necessity-class requirement
- Necessity-class closure must not be only a direct restatement of existing necessity theorem outputs.
- It must use endpoint-counterfactual route logic and physics-substance dependency route logic.

6. Pace-agnostic execution
- No deadlines, no cycle quotas, no velocity metrics.
- Progress is measured only by theorem-substance delta and passing substance gates.

Minimum substantive gate for QM/GR inevitability lane:
- QM must include and maintain theorem tokens:
  - `qm_inevitability_physics_substance_dependency_bundle_v0`
  - `qm_inevitability_endpoint_counterfactual_breaks_without_cycle7_dependency_v0`
  - `qm_inevitability_independent_necessity_class_from_endpoint_counterfactual_v0`
- GR must include and maintain theorem tokens:
  - `gr01_inevitability_physics_substance_dependency_bundle_v0`
  - `gr01_inevitability_endpoint_counterfactual_breaks_without_no_bridge_dependency_v0`
  - `gr01_inevitability_independent_necessity_class_from_endpoint_counterfactual_v0`

Pillar Definition of Done (full contract):
1. Full-derivation done (substantive physics)
- Canonical pillar theorem route is theorem-body discharged from declared primitive/physics assumptions.
- Route closure must be shown through explicit core-lemma calls, not token-only declaration or wrapper-only composition.

2. Discharge done (substantive closure)
- Discharge endpoint theorem must be present and must close the bounded canonical route.
- Counterfactual theorem must prove endpoint failure when a required dependency is removed.
- Route must satisfy anti-circularity and anti-shortcut constraints at theorem-body level.

3. Inevitability done (substantive necessity)
- Necessity theorem, endpoint-counterfactual theorem, and independent necessity-class theorem are all present.
- Independent necessity-class theorem must not be a direct restatement of the necessity theorem.
- Theorem-body tests must verify required dependency calls for necessity/counterfactual/classification route logic.

4. Canonical synchronization done (minimal but required)
- Gate/full/state/results/roadmap surfaces are synchronized to the same bounded adjudication posture.
- Synchronization is downstream of theorem-body closure, not a substitute for it.

5. Disallowed closure patterns
- Governance-only closure (docs/tests/tokens without theorem-body delta) is not done.
- Formatting-only/test-order-only changes are not done.
- Any closure relying on placeholder route assumptions without enforced dependency theorems is not done.

Non-goals:
- This protocol does not define publication deadlines.
- This protocol does not change bounded-scope/non-claim boundaries.
