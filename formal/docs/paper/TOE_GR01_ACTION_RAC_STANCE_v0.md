# TOE-GR-01 Action/RAC Stance v0

Spec ID:
- `TOE_GR01_ACTION_RAC_STANCE_v0`

Classification:
- `P-POLICY`

Purpose:
- Freeze the paper-facing stance for default-path action/RAC dependencies while GR01 remains derivation-grade blocked.
- Prevent silent drift between "conditional derivation" and "retired assumptions" narratives.

## Selected Stance (v0)

- Conservative conditional-derivation stance is selected.
- `hAction` and `hRAC` remain explicit theorem assumptions on the default quotient path.
- No claim is made that action/RAC obligations are fully retired in this artifact.
- Selected GR01 closure endpoint:
  - `conditional-publish endpoint` is selected.
  - GR01 may close as a derivation-grade conditional result with explicit non-retirement,
    while retirement remains a future scoped target.

## Scope

- Applies to:
  - `TOE_GR01_weak_field_poisson_limit_under_default_quotient_assumptions`
  - `gr01_discrete_residual_from_bridge_promotion_chain`
  - `gr01_end_to_end_chain_bundle_under_promoted_assumptions`
- Pointer surfaces:
  - `formal/docs/paper/TOE_GR01_THEOREM_SURFACE_v0.md`
  - `formal/docs/paper/TOE_GR01_ANALYTIC_DISCHARGE_v0.md`
  - `formal/docs/paper/DERIVATION_TARGET_GR01_DERIVATION_GRADE_CHECKLIST_v0.md`
  - target ID: `TARGET-GR01-ACTION-RAC-RETIREMENT-ALIGNMENT-PLAN`
  - `formal/docs/paper/DERIVATION_TARGET_GR01_ACTION_RAC_RETIREMENT_ALIGNMENT_v0.md`

## Retirement Alignment Criteria

- A future retirement update may be applied only if all are explicit:
  - replacement derivation or discharge object for action provenance,
  - replacement derivation or discharge object for RAC obligation set,
  - unchanged non-claim boundary until theorem/evidence surfaces are promoted under governance.
