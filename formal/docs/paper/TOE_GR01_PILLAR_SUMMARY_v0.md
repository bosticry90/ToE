# TOE GR01 Pillar Summary v0

Summary ID:
- `TOE_GR01_PILLAR_SUMMARY_v0`

Scope:
- bounded/discrete weak-field v0 only
- no continuum-limit promotion
- no full-GR claim

One-page summary:
- GR01 establishes a bounded/discrete Newton–Poisson emergence route under explicit assumptions.
- Assumptions are now ledgered and classed (`MATH`/`DEF`/`POLICY`/`SCOPE`) with minimized bundles.
- Robustness families and hard negative controls are populated with deterministic lock artifacts.
- Resolution trend records are populated at 32/64/128 with explicit trend fields.
- Failure modes are encoded with deterministic reason codes and failing-contract tokens.

Current governance status:
- `GR01_HARDENING_ADJUDICATION: DISCHARGED_v0_DISCRETE_HARDENED`
- `GR01_ROBUSTNESS_PROGRESS_v0: ALL_REQUIRED_PERTURBATION_ROWS_POPULATED`
- `GR01_NEGATIVE_CONTROL_PROGRESS_v0: ALL_REQUIRED_NEGATIVE_ROWS_POPULATED`
- `GR01_RESOLUTION_TREND_PROGRESS_v0: ALL_REQUIRED_RESOLUTION_ROWS_POPULATED`

Known limitations:
- no continuum-limit convergence claim
- no uniqueness/infinite-domain inversion claim
- no black-hole/full-GR semantics claim
- bridge-side modeling assumptions remain explicitly scoped
