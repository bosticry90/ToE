# Derivation Target: Thermo Entropy Object v0

Spec ID:
- `DERIVATION_TARGET_THERMO_ENTROPY_OBJECT_v0`

Target ID:
- `TARGET-TH-ENTROPY-PLAN`

Classification:
- `P-POLICY`

Purpose:
- Freeze one planning-only thermodynamics/statistical target for entropy-balance closure posture.
- Keep regime assumptions and non-equilibrium scope explicit.

Non-claim boundary:
- planning-only artifact.
- non-claim control surface.
- does not promote claim labels by itself.
- no comparator-lane authorization.
- no full statistical mechanics completion claim.
- no external truth claim.

Minimum structural objects required:
- entropy/entropy-production object
- flux/balance object
- regime assumptions (equilibrium or non-equilibrium) object
- admissibility/causality constraints for the selected regime

Closure definition:
- typed thermo/stat theorem/derivation surface exists with explicit assumptions.
- explicit regime validity and bounded non-claims.
- paper/state/results pointers are synchronized.
