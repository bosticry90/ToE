# Derivation Target: Cosmology Background Object v0

Spec ID:
- `DERIVATION_TARGET_COSMOLOGY_BACKGROUND_OBJECT_v0`

Target ID:
- `TARGET-COSMO-BG-PLAN`

Classification:
- `P-POLICY`

Purpose:
- Freeze one planning-only cosmology target for background-expansion closure posture.
- Keep metric/expansion assumptions explicit and bounded.

Non-claim boundary:
- planning-only artifact.
- non-claim control surface.
- does not promote claim labels by itself.
- no comparator-lane authorization.
- no full cosmological model completion claim.
- no external truth claim.

Minimum structural objects required:
- background metric object
- expansion-rate/Hubble-like object
- source-sector object (effective stress/energy or equivalent)
- explicit domain-of-validity assumptions

Closure definition:
- typed cosmology theorem/derivation surface exists with explicit assumptions.
- explicit falsifiability hooks and regime limits.
- paper/state/results pointers are synchronized.
