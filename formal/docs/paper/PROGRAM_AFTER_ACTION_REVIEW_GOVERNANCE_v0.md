# Program After-Action Review Governance v0

Spec ID:
- `PROGRAM_AFTER_ACTION_REVIEW_GOVERNANCE_v0`

Classification:
- `P-POLICY`

Authority:
- This document is authoritative for ToE program execution priorities and sequencing.
- If another planning note conflicts with this document, this document controls unless superseded by a newer versioned governance spec.

Adjudication token:
- `PROGRAM_AAR_GOVERNANCE_ADJUDICATION: ACTIVE_v0`

---

## 1) Purpose

This document turns the program After-Action Review (AAR) into enforceable operating rules.

Goal:
- keep the ToE program scientifically disciplined,
- prevent self-deception and scope drift,
- preserve anti-circular derivation quality,
- and focus effort on highest-leverage work.

---

## 2) Plain-language glossary (mandatory meanings)

- **ToE**: Theory of Everything program.
- **Governance-first architecture**: rules + tests that control claims and promotion.
- **Anti-circular**: no proof route may assume the same thing it claims to derive.
- **Canonical route**: the main proof route that is claim-authoritative.
- **Compatibility route**: a helper route kept for support/backward compatibility, not claim-authoritative.
- **Bounded/discrete scope**: finite-grid, finite-domain scope; not continuum physics.
- **Promotion**: changing a claim status upward (for example from blocked/conditional to proved).
- **Modeling assumption weight**: how much a claim depends on strong assumptions instead of derivation.
- **Predictive deviation**: a specific, testable prediction that could be wrong.
- **Pillar inevitability**: an internal milestone where a pillar claim is forced by canonical derivation in declared scope.

---

## 3) Mission statement (enforceable)

Program mission is:
1. Construct a formally governed derivation framework.
2. Enforce anti-circular discipline.
3. Demonstrate structural inevitability in bounded regimes.
4. Expand regime-by-regime only after closure criteria are met.

The program MUST NOT present itself as full-physics completion unless scope explicitly supports that claim.

---

## 4) What worked and must continue (non-negotiable)

The program MUST preserve all of the following:

1. **Governance-first architecture**
   - status tokens,
   - explicit assumption registry,
   - locked result/status surfaces,
   - promotion boundaries enforced by tests,
   - deterministic replay discipline.

2. **Bounded scope discipline**
   - every claim must include explicit scope bounds,
   - no silent lane expansion,
   - no cross-anchor unification claims without explicit discharge.

3. **Anti-circular derivation gates**
   - canonical routes must be anti-circular by theorem body and gate policy,
   - placeholder/proxy regressions are forbidden.

4. **Structural decomposition**
   - no monolithic “derive all physics at once” attempts,
   - derive module-by-module, then compose.

5. **Discrete-first formalization discipline**
   - finite/explicit surfaces first,
   - no analytic handwaving in place of derivation objects.

---

## 5) Gaps that must be improved (required work areas)

The program MUST explicitly work the following gaps:

1. **Derivation vs modeling boundary**
   - reduce modeling-assumption size over time,
   - split large policy assumptions into smaller derivable pieces.

2. **External anchoring strength**
   - move beyond compatibility-only posture,
   - introduce at least one narrow falsifiable predictive-deviation target.

3. **Structural redundancy risk**
   - simplify active operating surfaces,
   - maintain one canonical state narrative for execution decisions.

4. **Derivation diversity**
   - not only algebraic transport,
   - include variational, symmetry-first, constraint-closure, and limiting-behavior strategies where appropriate.

5. **Promotion psychology risk control**
   - internal milestone completion MUST NOT be described as universal physics completion.

---

## 6) Program phase policy

### Phase 1 — Stabilization (short term)
MUST:
- freeze GR01 v0 as a closed derivation unit,
- extract minimal canonical derivation narrative,
- simplify active document hierarchy,
- remove deprecated legacy bridge routes from canonical authority paths.

### Phase 2 — Depth over breadth
MUST:
- choose one depth target at a time:
  - A) continuum-lift strength for GR01,
  - B) modeling-assumption reduction,
  - C) first predictive-deviation test.
- MUST NOT open multiple major tracks in parallel as primary execution lanes.

### Phase 3 — Mathematical diversification
MUST:
- add at least one non-algebraic derivation strategy to active closure work.

---

## 7) Top five actionable program directives (binding)

1. Reduce modeling-bridge size.
2. Consolidate documentation layers.
3. Introduce first falsifiable predictive deviation.
4. Add non-algebraic derivation strategies.
5. Define explicit long-term inevitability criteria.

All five directives are mandatory and continuous.

---

## 8) Execution guardrails (binding)

- Governance MUST NOT be weakened for speed.
- Scope labels are mandatory for every promotion-facing claim.
- Canonical and compatibility routes must remain explicitly separated.
- Any promotion flip MUST be test-gated and replayable.
- No claim may be promoted by narrative argument alone.

---

## 9) Success criteria for this governance artifact

This artifact is functioning correctly when:
- execution remains organized around the mission and directives above,
- planning drift is reduced,
- anti-circular quality remains enforced,
- and roadmap decisions can be justified by this document without ambiguity.

---

## 10) Change control

- Changes to this policy require a versioned successor document.
- Successor must preserve all glossary definitions or explicitly redefine them.
- Successor must state which directives are retained, modified, or retired.
