# Physics Paper Outline v0

Spec ID:
- `PHYSICS_PAPER_OUTLINE_v0`

Classification:
- `P-POLICY`

Purpose:
- Freeze a physics-first manuscript outline so paper construction is led by model/derivation/falsifiability content, not governance narration.

Non-claim boundary:
- planning-only outline artifact.
- no theorem promotion by itself.
- no external truth claim.

## 1. Model And Assumptions

- Present model primitives and scoped domain.
- List assumption IDs and freeze boundaries.
- State explicit non-claims.

## 2. Derivation Chain (Primary Result)

- Derive weak-field Poisson-form closure under explicit assumptions.
- Show theorem-chain interface and analytic discharge alignment.
- Keep action/RAC stance explicit.

## 3. Dimensional And Symmetry Posture

- Present 3D weak-field posture token (`nabla_3D^2 Phi = kappa * rho`).
- State covariance and gauge roadmap interfaces (SR/EM targets).
- Separate posture tokens from discharged claims.

## 4. Limit Recoveries

- GR weak-field limit (current focus).
- Explicitly bounded interfaces for SR/EM/QM follow-on targets.
- Domain-of-validity statements per limit.

## 5. Falsifiability And Failure Modes

- Enumerate conditions that invalidate scoped derivation claims.
- Enumerate measurable/discriminating hooks where available.
- Distinguish support artifacts from theorem/evidence claims.

## 6. Scope, Risks, And Programmatic Next Steps

- Identify remaining blockers (derivation-grade discharge + action/RAC alignment).
- Define post-GR01 unlock sequence (SR/EM first).
- State publication staging posture (pillar-by-pillar, no over-claim).

## 7. Equivalence And Literature Mapping

- Provide explicit mainstream-equivalence theorem statement and constants/scaling map.
- Include assumption minimization audit table (mathematical necessity / physical postulate / regularity constraint).
- Map each derivation step side-by-side to canonical textbook/literature derivation steps.
