# Derivation Target: EM U1/Maxwell Object v0

Spec ID:
- `DERIVATION_TARGET_EM_U1_MAXWELL_OBJECT_v0`

Target ID:
- `TARGET-EM-U1-PLAN`

Classification:
- `P-POLICY`

Purpose:
- Freeze one planning-only EM target for U(1)/Maxwell-structure recovery posture.
- Keep assumptions explicit and bounded while preventing scope drift.
- Define the first nontrivial EM object set to unlock immediately after GR01 derivation-grade closure.

Non-claim boundary:
- planning-only artifact.
- non-claim control surface.
- does not promote claim labels by itself.
- no comparator-lane authorization.
- no Standard Model completion claim.
- no external truth claim.

Minimum structural objects required:
- gauge field object
- field-strength object
- source/current object
- gauge-redundancy/invariance contract

Canonical EM object checklist (v0 planning):
1. Gauge potential object:
   - typed `A_mu` carrier for U(1) posture.
2. Field-strength object:
   - typed `F_munu` structure from gauge potential differentials.
3. Source/current object:
   - typed `J_mu` source carrier with explicit continuity assumptions.
4. Gauge contract:
   - explicit theorem-shaped invariance contract under U(1) gauge action.
5. Falsifiability hook:
   - explicit statement of what would invalidate this EM posture in scoped assumptions.

Unlock condition:
- `LOCKED` until `TARGET-GR01-DERIV-CHECKLIST-PLAN` is `CLOSED` in `PHYSICS_ROADMAP_v0.md`.

Closure definition:
- typed EM theorem/derivation surface exists with explicit assumptions.
- domain-of-validity and falsifiability hooks are explicit.
- paper/state/results pointers are synchronized.

Non-claim boundary reinforcement:
- no non-Abelian gauge completion claim.
- no Standard Model completion claim.
- no external truth claim.
