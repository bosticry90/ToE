# Project After Action Review v0 (2026-02-16)

Spec ID:
- `PROJECT_AAR_v0`

Classification:
- `P-POLICY`

Purpose:
- Provide a canonical after-action review (AAR) of project execution through 2026-02-16.
- Record mission intent, achieved outcomes, unresolved gaps, and forward sustainment/improvement priorities.
- Define measurable quarterly objectives with gate-ready acceptance criteria for framework, methodology, and physics.

Non-claim boundary:
- This artifact is governance/policy only.
- This artifact does not change claim labels in `formal/docs/paper/RESULTS_TABLE_v0.md`.
- This artifact does not substitute for theorem surfaces, adjudication artifacts, or reproducibility evidence.

## 1) Mission Intent (What We Set Out To Do)

Primary mission (discipline-first):
- Build a make-it-a-theorem program where each target is explicit, assumptions are typed, scope limits are explicit, anti-circularity is enforced, and closure is test-gated.

Secondary mission (physics execution under bounded scope):
- Demonstrate that selected physics-lane outputs can be discharged from explicit object/bridge chains under declared assumptions and governance controls, rather than inserted as unchecked claims.

Operational doctrine retained:
- Target-first planning.
- Typed assumption ledgers.
- Non-vacuous theorem surfaces.
- Deterministic lock artifacts.
- Matrix/roadmap/results synchronization with enforcement tests.

## 2) Outcome Assessment (Did We Achieve the Goal?)

### 2.1 Mission Outcome: Discipline-First Program

Assessment: `ACHIEVED (bounded v0 governance scope)`

Evidence posture:
- Canonical results taxonomy remains synchronized and explicit about claim classes and non-claims (`formal/docs/paper/RESULTS_TABLE_v0.md`).
- Structural map remains planning-only and non-promotional by design (`formal/docs/paper/STRUCTURAL_CLOSENESS_MAP_v0.md`).
- Pillar activation and closure controls remain explicit (`formal/docs/paper/PHYSICS_ROADMAP_v0.md`).
- State ledger records cycle-stamped promotion/discharge transitions (`State_of_the_Theory.md`).

### 2.2 Mission Outcome: Physics-Lane Discharge Under Scope

Assessment: `PARTIALLY ACHIEVED (strong bounded progress; not full mainstream-equivalence)`

Observed achievements in current canon:
- SR covariance derivation lane promoted to bounded theorem-discharge closure posture:
  - `TOE-SR-THM-01: T-PROVED` with bounded non-claim boundary.
  - `PILLAR-SR: CLOSED` in activation matrix.
- GR weak-field/full-derivation bounded lane has discharged package rows (including `TOE-GR-FULL-01: T-PROVED`) under explicit bounded/discrete scope.
- QM evolution lane has theorem/contract hardening progress and adjudication surfaces pinned.

Observed limits in current canon:
- Mainstream-equivalence coverage remains incomplete in multiple pillars at equal evidentiary grade.
- Structural map still identifies `ABSENT`/planning-only regions (notably conservation-family completeness and broad cross-regime closure requirements).
- Many important rows remain explicitly conditional, blocked, or policy-scoped by design.

Bottom line:
- We achieved the project’s methodological mission and multiple bounded physics discharges.
- We have not yet achieved a complete, cross-pillar, mainstream-equivalent ToE closure package.

## 3) Sustainments (What Must Continue)

### 3.1 Framework Sustainments
- Preserve strict separation between planning surfaces and claim/evidence surfaces.
- Preserve explicit non-claim boundaries for every bounded discharge row.
- Preserve assumption-ledger discipline with stable IDs and theorem-signature bindings.
- Preserve lock-token synchronization across:
  - state ledger,
  - target docs,
  - results table,
  - physics roadmap,
  - Lean theorem surfaces,
  - deterministic artifacts,
  - enforcement tests.

### 3.2 Methodology Sustainments
- Keep anti-circularity controls explicit (no direct insertion of endpoint equations/claims).
- Keep theorem-surface non-vacuity checks as promotion prerequisites.
- Keep deterministic evidence generation and pinned artifact fingerprints.
- Keep gate-first promotion behavior (no label/matrix changes without required test/doc sync).

### 3.3 Physics Sustainments
- Keep bounded-scope honesty in all rows (domain, regime, inversion, uniqueness, continuum limitations).
- Keep bridge-chain transparency (object -> bridge -> closure -> adjudication).
- Keep blocker rows visible instead of silently redefining scope.

## 4) Improvements Required (What Must Change)

### 4.1 Framework Improvements
- Add a universal promotion ladder with explicit tiers:
  - `T-CONDITIONAL` -> `T-PROVED (bounded)` -> `T-PROVED (cross-regime bounded)` -> `T-PROVED (expanded scope)`.
- For each tier, define mandatory evidence families and non-claim clauses.
- Add canonical rollback policy for claim-label regressions (artifact/test/doc mismatch cases).

### 4.2 Methodology Improvements
- Upgrade from verification-heavy posture to full V&V discipline:
  - Verification: theorem correctness, lock determinism, gate consistency.
  - Validation: benchmark behavior, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification.
- Introduce mandatory numerical credibility bundle where numerics are used:
  - convergence diagnostics,
  - boundary-condition sensitivity,
  - uncertainty/error-budget reporting,
  - analytic-case validation set.
- Add preregistered acceptance thresholds for each numeric gate before execution starts.

### 4.3 Physics Improvements
- GR:
  - advance from compatibility-level conservation posture toward theorem-family completion where planned;
  - continue mainstream 3D robustness expansion under explicit bounded constraints and declared non-claims.
- QM:
  - continue measurement/semantics and symmetry-object transitions from planning to theorem-conditional surfaces.
- SR:
  - maintain closure integrity and prioritize regression prevention via synchronized gate enforcement.
- Cross-pillar:
  - unify assumptions and closure semantics so equivalent claim labels imply comparable evidentiary strength across pillars.

## 5) Quarterly Objectives and Gate-Ready Acceptance Criteria

Reporting window:
- Baseline at 2026-02-16.
- Objectives below are governance objectives; they do not self-promote claim labels.

### Q2 2026 (Stabilization + Measurement Discipline)

Objective set:
1. Establish a canonical promotion-tier rubric for all pillars.
2. Establish canonical V&V split and numeric credibility minimums.
3. Zero unresolved doc/results/roadmap/test drift at closeout checkpoints.

Acceptance gates (all required):
- `AAR-Q2-GATE-01` (Promotion Rubric Published)
  - Pass criteria:
    - New canonical policy artifact defines promotion tiers, required evidence families, and rollback triggers.
    - At least one worked example mapping existing SR and GR rows into rubric tiers.

    - Canonical policy artifact defines verification vs validation deliverables and required numeric credibility components.
    - At least one current numeric lane tagged with explicit V and V ownership rows.
- `AAR-Q2-GATE-03` (Drift-Prevention Enforcement)
  - Pass criteria:
    - Enforcement tests exist and pass for synchronized status terms across `RESULTS_TABLE_v0.md`, `PHYSICS_ROADMAP_v0.md`, and state ledger references.
    - End-of-quarter runbook includes deterministic command set and expected pass envelope.

### Q3 2026 (Physics Surface Expansion Under Controlled Scope)

Objective set:
1. Promote at least one currently planning-only structural object per active pillar (where feasible) into theorem-conditional or explicit blocked-with-discharge-path posture.
2. Expand conservation and cross-regime closure contracts where already scaffolded.
3. Add numeric credibility bundles to all new computationally-supported promotions.

Acceptance gates (all required):
- `AAR-Q3-GATE-01` (Structural Object Lift)
  - Pass criteria:
    - At least two previously planning-only or absent objects receive explicit theorem-surface or blocker-discharge package updates with assumption IDs and non-claim clauses.
- `AAR-Q3-GATE-02` (Conservation/Cross-Regime Upgrade)
  - Pass criteria:

    - Results-row language explicitly distinguishes compatibility, existence, and full-family completion statuses.
- `AAR-Q3-GATE-03` (Numeric Credibility Bundle)
  - Pass criteria:
    - Each new numeric-backed promotion includes convergence summary, sensitivity checklist, and uncertainty statement artifacts.

### Q4 2026 (Cross-Pillar Harmonization + Auditability)

Objective set:
1. Harmonize claim-strength semantics across SR/GR/QM where labels match.
2. Deliver a project-level audit pack proving no hidden scope expansion occurred.
3. Define 2027 blocker retirement sequence based on explicit residual gaps.

Acceptance gates (all required):
- `AAR-Q4-GATE-01` (Label Semantics Harmonization)
  - Pass criteria:
    - Canonical policy row maps every active claim label to mandatory evidence and non-claim templates.
    - Spot-check audit confirms consistency across at least SR, GR, and QM representative rows.
- `AAR-Q4-GATE-02` (Scope-Integrity Audit Pack)
  - Pass criteria:
    - Audit artifact set shows scope boundaries remained explicit and unchanged unless accompanied by approved promotion rubric evidence.
- `AAR-Q4-GATE-03` (2027 Blocker Retirement Plan)
  - Pass criteria:
    - Ranked blocker retirement ledger includes dependencies, required theorem artifacts, required tests, and stop/go criteria.

## 6) Program-Level Risks and Mitigations

Risk `R-AAR-01` (Governance Drift):
- Description: row wording and test expectations diverge; promotion posture becomes ambiguous.
- Mitigation: synchronized token vocabulary tests + quarterly drift audit gate.

Risk `R-AAR-02` (Verification-Validation Imbalance):
- Description: theorem/lock rigor outpaces physics-grade validation credibility.
- Mitigation: V&V split policy + mandatory numeric credibility bundle for numeric-backed promotions.

Risk `R-AAR-03` (Scope Inflation):
- Description: bounded achievements are informally interpreted as universal claims.
- Mitigation: enforce non-claim clauses in results rows and publication surfaces; require explicit scope-elevation evidence before any broader wording.

Risk `R-AAR-04` (Cross-Pillar Inconsistency):
- Description: equal labels carry unequal evidentiary weight across pillars.
- Mitigation: Q4 harmonization gate with label-evidence template mapping.

## 7) Governance Cadence (Operational)

Monthly:
- Run canonical gate suites and publish drift report (pass/fail + diffs).
- Reconcile roadmap/results/state language for newly changed rows.

Quarterly:
- Execute AAR gates (`AAR-Qx-GATE-*`) and publish pass/fail report.
- Update blocker retirement ordering with dependency changes.

Release checkpoint rule:
- No claim-label or pillar-status promotion unless required quarter gate pack is complete and passing.

## 8) AAR Executive Decision

Decision:
- Continue current theorem-first program as the project backbone.
- Prioritize methodology upgrades (V&V + numeric credibility) and cross-pillar harmonization before broadening claim scope language.

Current posture statement:
- The project is successful as a disciplined derivation framework with meaningful bounded physics progress.
- The project remains incomplete as a full mainstream-equivalent ToE closure package and should be managed accordingly.
