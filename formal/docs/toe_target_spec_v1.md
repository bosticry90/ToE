# ToE Target Spec v1

Spec ID:
- TOE-TARGET-SPEC/v1

Purpose:
- Governed checklist for the ToE end-state claims and admissibility scope.
- This is a governance artifact only; it does not assert physics truth.

Non-negotiable targets (must be addressed by comparator/falsifier lanes):
- Locality/causality statement (exact or explicitly emergent).
- Relativity statement (Lorentz/Poincare exact or emergent in a declared limit).
- Gravity statement (diffeo-covariant dynamics or an explicit effective metric limit).
- Quantum statement (operational definition for quantized excitations).
- Thermodynamic statement (second-law compatible coarse-graining or bounded violations).

Progress ladder (must be satisfied in order):
- Structural (Lean) definitions and admissibility.
- Behavioral (Python) comparator evidence.
- Empirical anchoring (external evidence cited and pinned).
- Cross-domain consistency (overlap regimes).
- Uniqueness/necessity (alternatives ruled out or strictly constrained).

Notes:
- Cross-rep comparator claims must satisfy representation-eligibility predicates.
- This spec is intentionally minimal; it exists to prevent drift.
