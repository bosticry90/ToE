STATUS: PARTIALLY RETIRED (reference-only)

Executed up to: FN-01 / MT-01 / BR-01 guardrail pipeline (front doors, candidate tables, locks, DAG enforcement, fit artifacts).
Remainder: migrate/interpret as ideas for Viability Roadmap.txt (the active scientific roadmap).

Do not treat this file as “what to do next”; treat it as historical context / execution log.

Practical action plan (commit-sized) for Option 1
A. Baseline (Markdown lock)

Create: formal/markdown/locks/constraints/SYM-01_symmetry_gates.md containing:

Definitions (probe-relative where needed) for:

Global phase invariance: ψ ↦ e^{iθ} ψ

Translation invariance: (x,y,t) ↦ (x+a, y+b, t+c)

Rotation invariance (2D): (x,y) ↦ R(x,y)

“Gate → PASS/FAIL/UNDECIDED” classification rules for deformation terms/operators.

B. Gate (Lean, structural)

Add minimal interfaces in Lean:

A predicate like PhaseInvariant (P : Field2D → Field2D) expressed as:

P (e^{iθ}•ψ) = e^{iθ}•P ψ (or your project’s scalar action)

Similar for translation/rotation, but probe-relative versions are acceptable if you keep it explicit (e.g., invariance on planeWave probes).

C. Consequence (Python behavioral)

Add tests:

For each candidate deformation representative, check invariance numerically under:

phase rotations,

spatial shifts,

rotations (where implementable on grid / spectral representation),

and record expected failure modes.

D. Inventory wiring (State_of_the_Theory.md)

Add new inventory item(s), e.g.:

SY-01 (Constraint / Criterion): “Symmetry gate suite (phase/translation/rotation)”

Evidence: pointers to the new markdown lock + Python tests + Lean modules.

## Final state after execution (what changes, what does not)

**What changes**

* Constraint admission is now rule-bound, not discretionary
* CT-01 becomes the reference implementation
* Coherence is demoted from concept to testable deformation class

**What does not change**

* No status upgrades
* No ontological claims
* No expansion of physical interpretation

---

If you want the **next step**, the cleanest option is to:

* draft the **CAR-01 text verbatim** for insertion into the Workflow Constitution, or
* scaffold the **FN-01 deformation table** (pass / fail / undecided) in canonical inventory format.

Say which one to execute.

### Step 3 — Formalize “Constraint invariance” and “If you add X, Y breaks”

You want statements of the form:

* **Constraint invariance**: If `Op` satisfies invariance `I` and constraint `C`, then any extension `Op' = Op + Extra` preserves `C` **only if** `Extra` satisfies some necessary condition.
* **Breakage theorem**: If `Extra` violates that condition, you can prove a contradiction with `C`.

These become Lean theorems that match your new direction precisely.

### Step 4 — Define “Minimality” as a formal selection principle

A workable Lean notion:

* Define a set/class of admissible operators `𝒪` satisfying invariances and closure constraints.
* Define a partial order “adds structure” (e.g., extra terms, extra axioms, extra dependencies).
* Prove:

  * **Minimal element** exists (or provide constructive candidate).
  * Any strictly richer operator violates at least one invariance unless forced by an explicit new assumption.

This directly encodes: “Extra structure dies unless forced.”

### Step 5 — Mirror each Lean constraint with a Python behavioral test

For each invariance/constraint you formalize:

* Python test: generate random plane-wave parameters and numeric operators (finite-difference stencils, pseudo-spectral operators) and verify the constraint approximately.
* This keeps Lean and Python aligned without conflating authority.

## Immediate next commit-sized task (small, high-leverage)

1. Add `OperatorSignature.lean` defining:

* `Field2D`
* a structure `Op2D` with one field `Op : Field2D → Field2D`
* a predicate `PlaneWaveEigen (Op2D) : Prop` stating eigen-closure on `planeWave`
* a predicate `DispersionCompatible (Op2D) : Prop` that recovers your coefficient equality form

2. Prove one “selection principle” lemma:

* If `Op` is plane-wave-eigen with eigenvalue `μ(k)`, and you add an `Extra` that is plane-wave-eigen with eigenvalue `ν(k)`, then the new eigenvalue is `μ(k)+ν(k)` (or whatever your combination rule is), hence any constraint on `μ` is violated unless `ν` satisfies the constraint.

That single lemma is the first formal instance of:

> “If you add X, Y breaks.”

If you want, paste your current invariances/constraints in plain language (bullet list), and I will translate them into Lean predicates with the smallest viable set of axioms (no analytic claims) consistent with your workflow rules.
