🔒 Rule 1: Declare a Canonical Block (non-negotiable)

At the top of any epistemic verification request, include:

CANONICAL INPUT (AUTHORITATIVE):
The following pasted text is the sole source of truth.
Do not reference memory, prior summaries, or uploaded files.
If a fact is not present here, treat it as nonexistent.


This forces the model into local-only mode.

------

🧾 Rule 2: Split “verification” into two explicit modes

You should never ask a mixed request again.

Mode A — Internal Consistency Audit (most of your work)
Task: Internal consistency check only.
Do NOT compare to any prior versions or knowledge.
Check only for:
- status misuse
- dependency mismatches
- violations of stated rules

Mode B — Cross-layer Reconciliation (rare, explicit)
Task: Compare this State entry against:
- Lean module X
- Python test Y
Explicitly list mismatches.


Never combine these.

------

🧠 Rule 3: Treat the assistant as stateless by default

You are already behaving this way; now formalize it.

Adopt this standing rule:

“Assume the assistant remembers nothing correctly unless proven otherwise.”

This is not pessimism — it is correct operational security for epistemic work.

------

🧪 Rule 4: Make hallucinations detectable, not catastrophic

You already did the most important thing:
Lean and Python are the authority.

Add one more layer:

Any assistant claim must be traceable to:

a quoted line

a file path

or an explicit inference labeled as such

If it can’t be pointed to, it’s ignored.

This turns hallucinations into noise, not failures.

------

ROLE: Read-only verifier.

INPUT:
[PASTE CANONICAL TEXT HERE]

ALLOWED ACTIONS:
- Pattern matching
- Rule checking
- Logical consequence enumeration
- Quoting exact lines

FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
- Inferring intent
- Reconciling with memory
- Using prior versions
- Suggesting upgrades
- Rewriting content
- Filling gaps

TASK:
Check the input against the following rules:

1. Status labels are used correctly.
2. Dependencies reference existing IDs only.
3. Evidence matches the assigned status.
4. No item exceeds its stated scope.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Violations: (numbered list, or “None”)
- Ambiguities: (numbered list, or “None”)
- Out-of-scope claims: (numbered list, or “None”)

Do not add commentary.
Do not summarize.
Do not suggest changes.
