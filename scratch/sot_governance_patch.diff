 Exit criteria: At least one lane with a real FAIL mode (not only unknown), or a pinned justification for why unknown is acceptable in that lane.
-Notes: CT-01 probe/dispersion and solver-level ω-shift lanes are front-door-backed on pinned PTC cases (including conservative baseline, dissipative break case, and conservative amplitude/coupling/k variants). SYM01/PAR01/BC01 are now front-door-backed via deterministic B1 hooks artifacts (phase/pass + conjugation/fail, parity/pass + advection/fail, periodic-vs-Dirichlet boundary residuals). TR01 is report-backed via `time_reversal_error`; EN01 is report-backed via regime-specific `energy_delta` behavior. ST01 is front-door-backed via pinned bright-soliton cases and report shape metrics (`shape_residual`, `shape_peak_delta`, `shape_peak_ratio`).
-Falsifier families: dispersion/probe (CT01), solver consequence (ω-shift), symmetry (SYM01, PAR01, TR01), boundary handling (BC01), conservation/monotonicity (EN01), and soliton structure/shape preservation (ST01).

+Falsifier families: dispersion/probe (CT01), solver consequence (ω-shift), symmetry (SYM01, PAR01, TR01), boundary handling (BC01), conservation/monotonicity (EN01), soliton structure/shape preservation plus resolution/convergence adequacy (ST01), and trapped ground-state structure/shape stability under harmonic confinement (TG01).
 EN01 regime note: the FAIL case corresponds to a dissipative regime, not a universal “wrongness” claim; conservative vs. dissipative admissibility is now tracked as a named regime class.
 ST01 regime note: PASS corresponds to conservative-regime shape stability under the pinned v1 soliton run; FAIL corresponds to dissipative damping with measurable shape degradation.
+ST01 resolution note: the n64 -> n128 convergence lane is a pinned numerical adequacy check on the benchmark surface, not a universal physical claim.
+TG01 regime note: PASS corresponds to conservative trapped-state shape stability under pinned harmonic confinement; FAIL corresponds to dissipative damping with measurable trap-shape degradation.

-Notes: v1 surface is 1D periodic NLSE-like dynamics with cubic nonlinearity and optional damping; intended as the first executable physics target contract (not a proof of physical correctness). Report outputs include `time_reversal_error` in addition to dispersion/energy/norm/phase diagnostics. Policy B1 hooks are emitted as separate deterministic artifacts (`PTC_NLSE_V1_HOOKS*.json`) for SYM01/PAR01/BC01 so report schema remains stable while falsifier lanes stay front-door-driven. Manifest now includes plane-wave contract cases and bright-soliton benchmark cases; soliton IC is keyed by case_id substring ('soliton') and reports shape metrics (`shape_residual`, `shape_peak_delta`, `shape_peak_ratio`).
