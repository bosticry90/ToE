 Scope / limits: Dual-lane comparator surface: v0 integrity-only (`comparator_role=integrity_only`) and v1 discriminative-candidate (`comparator_role=discriminative_candidate`) with cross-artifact residual `abs(c_s-c0)` under `TOE_CV01_TOLERANCE_PROFILE` (`pinned`/`portable`); deterministic records only; typed artifacts only; no external truth claim; blocked when pinned domain artifacts are missing; may be BLOCKED by admissibility manifest (CT01/SYM01/CAUS01).

 Notes: CV01 v0 remains frozen as a pipeline-integrity comparator. CV01 v1 is implemented as a separate schema surface with non-tautological cross-artifact speed residual checks, deterministic cross/curved negative controls, and contract-complete blocked-output shape; tolerance policy is explicitly governed by `formal/docs/cv01_numeric_tolerance_policy.md` (`TOE_CV01_TOLERANCE_PROFILE`). Domain pin source is `formal/docs/first_empirical_comparator_domain_bec_bragg.md` with canonical artifacts `formal/external_evidence/bec_bragg_steinhauer_2001/dr01_fit_artifact.json` and `formal/external_evidence/bec_bragg_steinhauer_2001/dr01_fit_artifact_curved.json`.
